        <hr>

        Create a web app which would take two inputs. It would also have 4 buttons: +, -, x /. Based on the button
        clicked perform the operation on the two inputs. You can do this in React or vanillaJS based on your choice.
        Your time starts now.

        See, you have 15 minutes to code this question. Questions are simple. We want to test whether:

        a) You have done levelZero lectures properly. b) You can form logic like this and come up with a program.

        All questions will be having one logic to implement it.
